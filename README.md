# Next.js 15 App Router Bug: Deeply Nested Layouts and Dynamic Segments

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when using deeply nested layouts with dynamic segments.  The issue manifests as incorrect routing or unexpected rendering behavior.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when combining deeply nested layouts with dynamic segments within the app directory.  In certain scenarios, route matching fails, or the application renders the wrong component.  This can lead to inconsistent user experience and application errors.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to different routes to observe the unexpected behavior.

## Expected Behavior

The application should correctly match routes based on the dynamic segments defined in the file structure and render the appropriate components within the nested layout hierarchy.

## Actual Behavior

The application exhibits incorrect routing behavior, either failing to match routes correctly or rendering incorrect components.
